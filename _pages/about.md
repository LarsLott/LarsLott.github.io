I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/institut_en.html) at the University of Heidelberg. My research focuses on three separate areas, namely authoritarian regimes, conceptualization and measurement of regime transformation episodes (autocratization), and political economy of inequalities. I studied Political Science and Public Law in Heidelberg and received a B.A in Political Science and Public Law, and a M.A. in Political Science from Heidelberg University. In my paper-based PhD project, “Rethinking Inequality under Autocracy. Parties, Citizens and Preferences”, I investigate whether and how the institutional foundations of autocracies determine economic and political inequalities, and whether and how these inequalities affect ordinary citizens in the short and long-term. Three papers from my PhD project are published in [Democratization](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/fdem20/current), [Contemporary Politics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ccpo20/current), and [Comparative Governance and Politics](https://link.springer.com/journal/12286).

Since April 2019, I have been research associate at the Institute of Political Science. During my studies, I was involved in research projects as a student assistant and did an internship at the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB). Between October 2018 and September 2019, I was a research fellow at GIGA Hamburg in the Dictator’s Endgames project, funded by the DFG. For additional information, please refer to my curriculum vitae.
