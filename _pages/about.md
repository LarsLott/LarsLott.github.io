About me
======

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Heidelberg. I mostly work within comparative politics and comparative democratization. Since April 2019, I have been research associate at the Institute of Political Science. During my studies, I was involved in research projects as a student assistant and did an internship at the Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB). Between October 2018 and September 2019, I was a research fellow at GIGA Hamburg in the Dictator’s Endgames project, funded by the DFG. For additional information, please refer to my curriculum vitae.

My research focuses on three separate areas, namely authoritarian regimes, conceptualization and measurement of regime transformation episodes (autocratization), and political economy of inequalities. I studied Political Science and Public Law in Heidelberg and received a B.A in Political Science and Public Law, and a M.A. in Political Science from Heidelberg University. In my paper-based PhD project, “Rethinking Inequality under Autocracy. Parties, Citizens and Preferences”, I investigates whether and how the institutional foundations of autocracies determine economic and political inequalities, and whether and how these inequalities affect ordinary citizens in the short and long-term. Three papers from my PhD project are published in Democratization, Contemporary Politics, and Comparative Governance and Politics. 

On this website, you will find further information on my research and teaching. Thank you for your interest and please feel free to contact me.
