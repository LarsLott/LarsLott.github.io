My research relates to the fields of Comparative Politics, Democratization Research and Comparative Authoritarianism. I am particularly interested in studying how economic and political inequalities affect political behavior of authoritarian elites and citizens living under an autocratic regime as well as how to measure and conceptualize regime transformation epsiodes (autocratization and democratization). Empirically, I apply quantitative methods (multilevel models, matching methods for panel data) and adopt a comparative perspective (cross-national comparisons with a focus on autocracies). Below you find information on current working papers and projects.
